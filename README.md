# dotfiles
#### What is this?
This is a repository for my dotfiles also know as config files.  If you would like to use them you can.

#### Any plans?
Yes, I plan on improving my `polybar` config along with adding some keybindings to `urxvt`.

#### Installation
To install my dotfiles make the `install.sh` script executable with `chmod +x` and run it.  If you wish to remove my dotfiles from your system do the same with the `uninstall.sh` script.  Note that `uninstall.sh` will remove all the files `install.sh` installed including the `.xinitrc`.

#### Is that all?
For now yes.
